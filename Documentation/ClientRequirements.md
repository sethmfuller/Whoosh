# Requirements
> Household App

## Main Idea

The main function of this “household app” is to send alerts or small messages to groups of people. The focus group is a household but could expand to include any kind of group of people. If a member wanted to alert everybody in the group of something, e.g. “Dinner’s Ready!”, all he would have to do is clicked the “Dinner’s Ready” button and it would send everyone in the group the message through the application.
